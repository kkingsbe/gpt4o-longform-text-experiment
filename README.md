# Welcome
THis is just a simple experiment I made in an afternoon to see if it was feasible to write longer pieces of text with gpt-4o. Pretty interesting results, may add more updates.

## Samples
You can view sample pdfs in the /samples folder. The one labeled `(S_best)` is the best output currently

## Running
To run just install the deps `npm i` and start the server `npm run dev`. Send a post request to `localhost:3000/api/llm` with the topic in the body. Ex: `{ topic: "the future of ai" }`
